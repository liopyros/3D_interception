# 3D_interception
I used C# to bring my 2D Interception program into 3D space through the Unity game engine. As much as I was prepared to build my own game engine, I quickly discovered the incredible complexities involved; and while reinventing the wheel can be fun (if your goal is to learn about wheels), I found that the game engine design was adding a level of complexity that was keeping me distracted from the actual goaks that I had for this project. The 3D framework provided by Unity allowed me to refocus on my objectives in a much simpler way.

Fundamentally, the math here is very similar to the 2D Interception program. A target object is again denoted as red, and this time I am controlling its acceleration vector manually with designated buttons on my keyboard. After ascending vertically, you'll see the target starts to pitch downwards slightly before eventually becoming ballistic. While the target is in free fall, another button on my keyboard calculates and initiates the velocity and acceleration vectors of the intercepting object, again denoted as green.
